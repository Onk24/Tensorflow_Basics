# Tensorflow_Basics
Practicing implementations using Numpy, Tensorflow (mainly), Keras and Estimators for conceptual understanding and practice. The notebook captures following activities:
- A simple NN implementation using Numpy to derive a functional relationship
- TF basics
- Multiple Linear Regression implementation using Sklearn and TF: Compare coefficient obtained between the two for sanity check
- Nueral Network implementation TF
- Keras Sequential implementation 
- Estimator implementation using LinearRegressor() module
